# IkeaDB

This project was built during a Database management systems course. The database built imulates the activity of a furniture shop which, in the context of the pandemic, has improved its online platform. The database contains 25 entities with **randomly generated data entries**. I have implemented various features to help the users, such as:
- a function that takes the `id` of a product A and returns the **exact locations** in the shop of all the components of product A
- an algorithm that makes recommendations for every user based on their **previous purchases**
- an algorithm that makes recommendations to the user based on the product they are currently looking at, considering the **purchase patterns of all the customers**
- a procedure that prevents firing more employees than the shop can afford to, based on the employee being fired and the **minimal requirements set by the shop previously**
- a trigger that ensures a **safe inventory** of products at the end of every month
- a procedure that manages the **mentorship program** of the shop every month
- much more
